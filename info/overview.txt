index.php:

- website's structure is sent to user with additional data in <template> tags:
  * 50 latest messages
  * guest token and id 

- if token was sent with cookies, it gets verified:
  * if it exists in database, it gets sent back to user
  * if it doesn't, new token is created and sent to user
  * javascript sets cookie token, and uses token and id when sending messages

- everything is handled by javascripts
